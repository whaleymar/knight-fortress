short term:
- load entity/components from YAML
- physics/collision component(s?)
    - more accurate bounding boxes -> collision mesh
    - collision between two rigid bodies
    - trigger collision
    - entities which are movable + have a collider, but are not affected by collisions (isKinematic in unity)
    - figure out how forces/acceleration should work
    - circle colliders + collision between different shapes
    - toggle translucent colliders
- resizable screen
- animation changes should be queued until the current animation completes its frame time
- buffered inputs

when I need it:
- opengl instancing
- event flow system
- text rendering
- 2d texture array
- entity config files + hot reloading
- parallel everything
