short term:
- physics/collision component(s?)
    - better collision resolution
    - more accurate bounding boxes
    - figure out how forces/acceleration should work
    - circle colliders + collision between different shapes
- gravity
- jumping
- unloading entities (mainly need to free opengl vars)
- platforms
- resizable screen
- animation changes should be queued until the current animation completes its frame time

when I need it:
- event flow system
- text rendering
- 2d texture array
- entity config files + hot reloading
- parallel everything
