short term:
- clean up code (especially for textures)
    - 2d texture array
    - organize code into folders
- camera entity
    - I should do all calculations in texel coordinates and let the GPU do the transformations !!!
    - jittering after player stops moving
    - repeat texturing

- physics/motion scalars should be scaled by window size
- physics/collision component(s?)
- gravity
- jumping
- unloading entities (mainly need to free opengl vars)
- platforms

when I need it:
- event flow system
- text rendering

long term:
- entity config files + hot reloading
- parallel everything
