short term:
- clean up code (especially for textures)
    - 2d texture array
    - todos
    - organize code into folders
- camera entity
- physics/collision component(s?)
- gravity
- jumping
- unloading entities (mainly need to free opengl vars)
- platforms
- text rendering

long term:
- event system
- entity config files + hot reloading
- parallel everything
