short term:
- clean up entity naming / POD stuff
- clean up serialization code for entity
- key binding to save unique entities

- collision: GHOST vertices

- physics/collision component(s?)
    - collision between two rigid bodies
    - new collision components (de-abstract the current one)
        - trigger collision
            - hurt box
        - entities which are movable + have a collider, but are not affected by collisions (isKinematic in unity)
    - figure out how forces/acceleration should work
    - circle colliders + collision between different shapes
    - toggle translucent colliders (debug mode)
- resizable screen
- frame tracker:
    - animation changes should be queued until the current animation completes its frame time
    - buffered inputs
    - check if isgrounded every 4 frames

when I need it:
- opengl instancing
- event flow system
- text rendering
- 2d texture array
- parallel everything
